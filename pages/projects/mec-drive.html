							<h2>Linear Quadratic Regulator for Mecanum Drive</h2>
						</header>
						<p><strong>
							(If you have seen my differential steering controller, you can skip this first section)<br>
							For my testbed project, I needed a method of controlling robots to follow their
							respective paths. Controlling mobile robots in the context of motion planning is 
							essentially an issue of trajectory tracking. I opted to implement linear quadratic
							regulators, a type of optimal feedback controller that is similar to the robust 
							MPC controllers used in self-driving cars. I designed two different discrete-time 
							LQR's to be used for differential and mecanum drive robots. This page will cover 
							my implementation of mecanum drive control.

						<p><strong>
							Above is the state-space model and quadratic cost function for a discrete-time 
							LQR, hence giving it the name 'linear quadratic regulator'. The vector x_t represents
							the current state of the system, u_t represents the control action at the given moment,
							and x_t+1 is the next state. The cost function g is essentially the sum Qx^2 + Ru^2 
							that the LQR seeks to minimize. Since Q and R assign coefficients to the costs 
							of the x and u squred terms, they punish the magnitude of the state and control action
							respectively: at every given time frame, the cost of controlling the system is weighed
							against the cost of the state to calculate the optimal control action. For our purposes,
							the LQR finds a balance between its deviation from its path and its velocity.
						</strong></p>

						<p><strong>
							However, my system dynamics yielded unwanted behaviors: the mecanum
							drive controller asymptotically approached waypoints. To solve this, I re-formulated the 
							linear model to account for past control actions within its state, thus controlling its change 
							in velocities. The new state-space model can be seen above. One downside to this new model is 
							that state estimation becomes more difficultâ€”the controller now relies on both position and 
							velocity feedback to be functional.
						</strong></p>

						<p><strong>
							Shown above are the state variables, control vector, input matrix, and control matrix. 
							The state vector is defined by the robot's x and y coordinates alongside its orientation as an angle.
							Since mecanum drive is omnidirectional, the total velocity of the robot can be split into individual
							velocities spanning the x, y, and angular directions. At a given moment, the next state is a function
							of its current state and these velocities. Thus, the control vector is defined
							by the three velocities. The control and input matrices A and B are straightforward: A poses the state
							vector as a square matrix, and B multiplies the control vector to allow it to appropriately add to the state.
						</strong></p>
						<img src="../../images/fulls/dare.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="65"/>
						<p><strong>
							Above is the discrete time algebraic Riccati equation, which helps solve for the optimal control policy
							that ties the linear state space with the quadratic cost function. By inputting coefficient matrices A, B, Q, and R
							into this formula, we can iteratively solve for P until a reasonable margin of error has been achieved. 
						</strong></p>
						<img src="../../images/fulls/dare_sol.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="200"/>
						<p><strong>
							The solution to the algebraic Riccati equation is used to calculate the optimal gain matrix K. The control 
							policy is equal the state vector multiplied by this coefficient, which yields us an optimal control action at
							every time frame. Interestingly, unless the maximum velocity is limited to a small value (around 40 mm/s),
							the system experiences unwanted oscillations. In order to work around this, I implemented a PID
							controller that maintains the speed separately from the LQR; the LQR itself is only be responsible for the 
							directions of its velocities. Additionally, to make the trajectory tracking more accurate and robust, I 
							implemented a novel solution for the controller to be able to "see" incoming sharp turns and reduce its speed
							accordingly.
						</strong></p>
						<img src="../../images/fulls/turn-ex.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="200"/>
						<p><strong>
							Imagine the sequence of waypoints in the image above. The sharper this turn is, the more parallel the displacement vectors a and b
							become, all while pointing in opposite directions. Following this logic, the "worst-case" turn will 
							have two adjacent displacement vectors in perfectly opposing orientations; in other words, the 
							system's speed must be minimal at 180 degrees. Conversely, speed is maximized at 0 degrees.
							With this information, we can assign a rule to punish speed accordingly. The setpoint for the speed controller at each given point
							is a function
						</strong></p>
						<img src="../../images/fulls/turn-cost.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="300"/>
						<p><strong>
							From what has been established, we know that the punishment must be minimized at a change in angle of 0, and 
							maximized at a difference of 180 degrees or pi radians. Fortunately, the absolute value of the sine function
							has a local minima at 0, while the cosine function has a local minima at pi radians. Taking the negative of cosine
							yields a maximima at pi radians, which satisfies our need for a minimum at 0 and a maximum at pi.
						</strong></p>
						<img src="../../images/fulls/cost-func.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="300"/>
						<p><strong>
							Above is the piecewise function that penalizes speed. The cost C starts as 0 at 0 radians. As the angle approaches
							pi as it crosses the unit circle from either 0 to pi or 0 to -pi, C approaches 1. Using this piecewise, I am 
							able to dynamically manipulate the PID's setpoint as a function of C. 
						</strong></p>
						<img src="../../images/fulls/setpoint.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="250"/>
						<p><strong>
							Above is a method of changing the setpoint as a function of the cost C that I found through trial and error. 
							As you can see, the setpoint is minimized when cost = 1, or when the net turn is pi radians. The opposite is true 
							when the turn is measured to be 0.

							The final component of this controller is the inverse kinematic model for a four-wheel mecanum drive system. The leftmost vector represents the angular
							velocities of the front left, front right, rear left, and rear right wheels (in that order). The constants lx and ly 
							are equal to the half-lengths of the width and height of robot's chassis. Finally, the input vector consists of the x,
							y, and angular velocities. Not coincidentally, this velocity vector is the same as the control action used in the
							LQR. In other words, using this formula, we can solve for the angular speed of each individual wheel that will achieve 
							the motion described by the velocity vector. This is useful for mecanum drive robots that must be interfaced through
							motor actuation: the angular speed of each motor can correspond to an optimal level of actuation. For every control
							action calculated, there is a corresponding output for each wheel.
