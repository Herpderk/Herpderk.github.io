							<h2>Linear Quadratic Regulator for Mecanum Drive</h2>
						</header>
						<p><strong>
							(If you have seen my differential steering controller, you can skip this first section)<br>
							For my testbed project, I needed a method of controlling robots to follow their
							respective paths. Controlling mobile robots in the context of motion planning is 
							essentially an issue of trajectory tracking. I opted to implement linear quadratic
							regulators, a type of optimal feedback controller that is similar to the robust 
							MPC controllers used in self-driving cars. I designed two different discrete-time 
							LQR's to be used for differential and mecanum drive robots. This page will cover 
							my implementation of mecanum drive control.

						<p><strong>
							Above is the state-space model and quadratic cost function for a discrete-time 
							LQR, hence giving it the name 'linear quadratic regulator'. The vector x_t represents
							the current state of the system, u_t represents the control action at the given moment,
							and x_t+1 is the next state. The cost function g is essentially the sum Qx^2 + Ru^2 
							that the LQR seeks to minimize. Since Q and R assign coefficients to the costs 
							of the x and u squred terms, they punish the magnitude of the state and control action
							respectively: at every given time frame, the cost of controlling the system is weighed
							against the cost of the state to calculate the optimal control action. For our purposes,
							the LQR finds a balance between its deviation from its path and its velocity.

						<p><strong>
							However, my system dynamics yielded unwanted behaviors for both controllers: the mecanum
							drive controller asymptotically approached waypoints. To solve this, I re-formulated the 
							linear model to account for past control actions within its state, thus controlling its change 
							in velocities. The new state-space model can be seen above. One downside to this new model is 
							that state estimation becomes more difficultâ€”the controller now relies on both position and 
							velocity feedback to be functional.
